# SemanticSegmentation-Examples

**1. Semantic Webcam Segmentation using DeepLab-V3+:**

If you want to test the webcam application copy the juypter notebook you find in the folder of Webcam-Segmenation of this GitHub repository. Make sure, that the notebook should be inside your cloned DeepLab directory. 

You get the DeepLab directory on this link: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab

When you run it, you can see a real-time segmentation of your webcam.
