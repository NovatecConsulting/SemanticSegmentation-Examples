# SemanticSegmentation-Examples

**1. Semantic Webcam Segmentation using DeepLab-V3+:**

If you want to test the webcam application copy the juypter notebook you find in the folder of Webcam-Segmenation of this GitHub repository. Make sure, that the notebook should be inside your cloned DeepLab directory. 

You get the DeepLab directory on this link: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab

When you run it, you can see a real-time segmentation of your webcam.

**2. Carvana Image Masking Challenge: Training U-Net:**

First of all you have to download the datasets of the Carvana Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge

Make sure, that you have installed all the needed libraries and frameworks like tensorflow-GPU and Keras.
For this application, you will need a GPU.

Clone and run the provided Notebook (model_cnn) and train your model.
